<h1>The Antiquity and the Origins of Writing (around 3000 BC)</h1>
	<h2>Cuneiform Writing</h2>
		<p>
			The <b>cuneiform</b> script, which appeared in <b>Mesopotamia</b> around <b>3300 BC</b>, is considered to be one of the earliest 
			systems of <b>writing</b> history. Developed by the <b>Sumerians</b>, it was originally used for <b>administrative</b> purposes 
			and <b>accountants</b>, particularly to record <b>trade</b> flows and manage <b>agricultural</b> commodity stocks. The term 
			"<b>cuneiform</b>" comes from the Latin <b>cuneus</b>, meaning "corner", in reference to the shape of the characters in nails or corners, obtained 
			by pressing a cut <b>calama</b> from a reed rod onto wet <b>clay</b> tablets. Once engraved, these tablets were dried 
			sun or baked to ensure <b>sustainability</b>.
<br>
            Originally, the <b>cuneiform</b> script was <b>pictographic</b>: each symbol represented an object or idea. For example, a head drawing 
            de b≈ìuf meant "beef". Over time, these designs have been simplified and standardized, evolving into a system of <b>abstract</b> and <b>phonetic</b> signs. 
            This evolution has allowed to transcribe not only proper names and complex ideas, but also various languages such as <b>Sumerian</b>, <b>Akkadian</b>, 
            <b>Babylonian</b> and <b>Assyrian</b>, which has encouraged its adoption in a vast region of the <b>Middle East</b>.
<br>
            Beyond the simple <b>economic</b> management, <b>cuneiform</b> writing has been used for <b>religious</b> texts, codes of laws (such as the famous <b>Code of Hammurabi</b>), 
            <b>literary</b> narratives (such as The <b>Epic of Gilgamesh</b>), and <b>historical</b> documents. It allowed the creation of the first <b>libraries</b>, such as that of <b>Assurbanipal</b> 
            <b>Nineveh</b>, where thousands of tablets were found.This system lasted for more than <b>3,000 years</b>, before gradually disappearing with the advent of simpler <b>alphabets</b> such as those of the <b>Phoenicians</b>.
<br>
            The <b>cuneiform</b> script represents a major turning point in <b>human history</b>, marking the passage from <b>prehistory</b> to <b>history</b> and paving the way for <b>conservation</b> 
            and the lasting transmission of <b>knowledge</b> through the ages. Today, its decipherment in the <b>19th century</b> has allowed a better understanding of <b>ancient civilizations</b> and their contribution to our <b>cultural heritage</b>

	<h2>Papyrus</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Papyrus</b> is one of the earliest known <b>writing</b> materials, used mainly by <b>ancient Egyptian</b> civilizations from <b>3000 BC</b>. Made from the plant 
			of the same name, which grew in abundance along the <b>Nile</b>, it represented a major advance compared to the <b>clay</b> tablets used in <b>Mesopotamia</b>. The manufacture of <b>papyrus</b> consisted 
			to cut the stems of the plant into thin strips, which were arranged in crossed layers, hammered out and then glued together with natural <b>sap</b>. After drying, a sheet was obtained 
			flexible, lightweight and easy to carry.
<br>
            <b>Papyrus</b> was used to write with brushes or <b>calames</b> dipped in soot-based <b>ink</b> or natural <b>pigments</b>. It was mainly used to record <b>religious</b>, <b>administrative</b> 
            and <b>literary</b>, but also letters and <b>legal</b> contracts. The <b>papyrus</b> sheets could be assembled into rolls, making it easier to store and consult documents. 
            These scrolls, called <b>volumes</b>, were often stored in <b>libraries</b>, such as the famous <b>library of Alexandria</b>.
<br>
            The use of <b>papyrus</b> spread rapidly throughout the <b>Mediterranean</b> basin thanks to <b>Egyptian</b> trade. However, its fragility in the face of <b>humidity</b> and its relatively high cost limited its use to 
            important documents. From the <b>3rd century AD</b>, it was gradually replaced by <b>parchment</b>, made from animal skins, which was more durable and better suited to humid climates.
<br>
            Despite this, the <b>papyrus</b> remains a symbol of early <b>writing</b> and <b>knowledge</b> transmission. The fragments found today, thanks to the arid conditions of <b>Egypt</b>, offer us valuable testimonies 
            On the <b>culture</b>, <b>religion</b> and daily life of <b>antiquity</b>. It is an essential milestone in the history of <b>writing</b> media, linking early civilizations to later <b>technological</b> advances.

	<h2>Stylus and Wax Tablets</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Stylus</b> and <b>wax tablets</b> were widely used <b>writing</b> tools in <b>antiquity</b>, especially by the <b>Greeks</b> and <b>Romans</b>. The <b>wax tablet</b> consisted of a wooden frame filled with a thin 
			<b>wax</b> layer, forming a reusable surface for <b>writing</b>. The <b>stylus</b>, or <b>stylet</b>, was a sharp instrument made of <b>metal</b>, <b>bone</b> or <b>wood</b>, used to engrave letters or numbers in <b>wax</b>. The other end 
			of the <b>stylus</b>, flattened, allowed to erase the inscriptions by smoothing the <b>wax</b>, making this practical support for temporary writings.
<br>
            These tablets were used for a variety of tasks, from taking notes and writing <b>administrative</b> documents to teaching. Students, for example, used them to practice <b>writing</b> and 
            <b>mathematics</b>. The tablets could be connected together to form <b>diptychs</b> or <b>triptychs</b>, thus increasing the space available for <b>writing</b>, making them ideal for longer texts such as contracts or letters.
<br>
            The main advantage of <b>wax tablets</b> was their <b>reusability</b>, in contrast to more expensive media such as <b>papyrus</b> or <b>parchment</b>. They were particularly popular in environments where <b>writing</b> was required to be 
            frequently changed or corrected. However, their durability was limited: the <b>wax</b> could melt under the effect of heat or deteriorate over time.
<br>
            These tools were widely used throughout the <b>Roman Empire</b> and remained in use for several centuries, until the advent of <b>paper</b>. Their simplicity and economic character have made them essential supports for everyday life, including 
            for rapid communication and learning tasks. <b>Wax</b> <b>stylus</b> and <b>tablets</b> are now a fascinating testimony to the creativity of <b>ancient civilizations</b> in meeting their practical needs for <b>writing</b>.
