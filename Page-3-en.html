<h1>The invention of printing (15th century)</h1>
	<h2>Gutenberg (1450)</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Johannes Gutenberg</b>, a 15th century <b>German inventor</b>, is considered the father of modern <b>printing</b> thanks to the invention of <b>metal movable characters</b> around 1450. Before its innovation, books were copied by hand, a process 
			Long and expensive, or printed with engraved wood blocks, limiting the production of texts. <b>Gutenberg</b> revolutionizes this practice by designing a printing system based on individual, reusable and easily 
			<b>assembled</b> to form pages. It combines this technique with a press adapted, inspired by <b>wine presses</b>, allowing a fast and precise printing.
<br>
            <b>Gutenberg‚Äôs emblematic work</b> is the 42-line Bible, printed in 1455. This book, remarkable for its quality and readability, shows the potential of printing to produce large quantities of texts. Thanks to his invention, it is possible 
            to disseminate knowledge, religious texts and ideas on a scale never before imagined. Lower production costs make books more accessible, democratizing education and culture.
<br>
            The impact of <b>Gutenberg‚Äôs printing</b> is immense. It contributed to the <b>Protestant Reformation</b> by allowing the rapid dissemination of Luther‚Äôs writings, promoted the development of <b>science</b> by publishing scholarly works, and played a key role in the <b>Renaissance</b> by disseminating 
            the classical texts of antiquity. Within a century, <b>printing</b> spread throughout Europe, bringing about a real intellectual and cultural revolution.
<br>
            Although <b>Gutenberg</b> experienced financial difficulties and did not fully benefit from the spin-off of his invention, his contribution to history remains invaluable. Its <b>printing system</b> marks the beginning of the modern era of written communication, transforming profoundly 
            society by facilitating access to knowledge. Today, <b>Gutenberg</b> is recognized as one of the most influential figures in world history, his invention shaping the world as we know it.

	<h2>Printed books</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Printed books</b>, which were created in the mid-15th century by <b>Johannes Gutenberg‚Äôs invention of printing</b>, mark a turning point in the history of knowledge transmission. Before this revolution, books were laboriously hand-copied by monks or 
			Scribes, making their production long, expensive and reserved for an elite. <b>Printing</b>, based on reusable <b>metal movable characters</b>, allows for the first time mass production of texts, significantly reducing the cost and time required to manufacture them.
<br>
            The first printed books, called <b>incunables</b> (from Latin <b>incunabula</b>, meaning "in the cradle"), include mainly religious texts such as the famous 42-line <b>Gutenberg Bible</b> </b>, but also literary, scientific and legal works. Thanks to this new technology, 
            The spread of ideas is accelerating dramatically. <b>Printed books</b> helped the <b>Protestant Reformation</b>, the rise of <b>science</b> and the revival of classical studies, participating fully in movements such as the <b>Renaissance</b> and the Enlightenment.
<br>
            The <b>printed book</b> is also distinguished by its <b>standardization</b> and increased readability. It becomes possible to add innovations such as titles, indexes, pagination and tables of contents, making the use of books more convenient. Within a few decades, <b>printing</b> 
            They are emerging throughout Europe, transforming large cities into centres of cultural production.

            <b>Printed books</b> help to democratize access to knowledge, reaching a wider audience. With the increase in the number of schools and universities, they play a key role in literacy and intellectual training of populations. Their impact goes far beyond education: 
            They shape social, religious and political debates and become essential tools for progress. Even after several centuries, <b>printed books</b> remain a fundamental pillar of culture. Their sustainability, ability to gather and transmit ideas, and role in building modern societies all bear witness to their historical and contemporary importance.

	<h2>Paper</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Paper</b>, first introduced in China around 200 B.C. is a revolutionary invention that has transformed the transmission of knowledge and communication. Created by Cai Lun, an official of the imperial court, it is made from vegetable fibers such as bamboo, mulberry bark, 
			hemp or rags, which are ground, mixed with water and then dried into thin leaves. Lighter, cheaper and easier to produce than <b>papyrus</b> or <b>parchment</b>, <b>paper</b> quickly becomes an ideal writing medium.
<br>
            Its use is spreading throughout Asia through trade routes. In the 8th century, the technique of <b>paper production</b> reached the Arab world, where it was improved, especially in Baghdad, which became a major center of production. From the 12th century, <b>paper</b> was introduced to Europe via Spain 
            Muslim. Its production is intensified by the appearance of <b>paper mills</b>, which facilitate the processing of vegetable fibers.
<br>
            <b>Paper</b> played a key role in the development of <b>printing</b> in the 15th century. It gradually replaces <b>parchment</b>, too expensive for mass production, and allows the rapid manufacture of printed books, making knowledge more accessible. It also becomes indispensable for administrative documents, the 
            The European Commission has published a report on the European Union‚Äôs relations with the United States of America.
<br>
            Thanks to its versatility, <b>paper</b> can be used for many purposes: education, art, business and science. Over the centuries, it has evolved in terms of quality and production, particularly with the use of wood-based pulp in the 19th century, which further reduces costs and makes <b>paper</b> ubiquitous in everyday life. 
            Today, despite the increasing digitization, <b>paper</b> remains an essential support for many activities, including <b>printing</b>, packaging and art. Its long history is a testament to its central role in the development of civilizations and its lasting influence on human culture.
