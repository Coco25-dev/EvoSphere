<h1>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) (20th - 21st century)</h1>
    <h2>Augmented Reality (1990s)</h2>
        <p>
            Augmented reality (AR)</b>, developed in the <b>1990s</b>, is a technology that superimposes digital elements on our real-time environment. Unlike <b>virtual reality</b>, which immerses the user in an entirely virtual world, AR enriches the physical world by adding visual and audio information 
            or interactive, visible through devices such as <b>smart glasses</b>, <b>smartphones</b> or <b>tablets</b>.
<br>
            The concept of <b>augmented reality</b> took shape in the <b>1960s</b> with the first visualization systems, but it was in the <b>1990s</b> that technology became more concrete. In <b>1992</b>, researcher <b>Tom Caudell</b> introduced the term "<b>augmented reality</b>" to describe a tool used by <b>Boeing</b> to assist technicians in aircraft assembly. 
            Soon after, researchers design systems combining <b>cameras</b>, <b>sensors</b> and <b>displays</b> to insert virtual images into the user‚Äôs field of view.
<br>
            AR first finds applications in professional fields. It is used for training <b>surgeons</b>, <b>industrial maintenance</b> and <b>army</b>, where it provides critical information directly to the field of vision of <b>soldiers</b>. In <b>architecture</b> and <b>design</b>, AR facilitates the visualization of projects by 
            integrating 3D models into real environments.
<br>
            In the <b>2000</b> years, the rise of <b>smartphones</b> and <b>integrated cameras</b> democratizes AR. Apps like <b>Pok√©mon Go</b> (<b>2016</b>) are popularising this technology to the general public by integrating it into entertainment. At the same time, innovations like <b>HoloLens</b> from <b>Microsoft</b> or <b>Magic Leap</b> helmets push AR‚Äôs limits in 
            the <b>education</b>, <b>health</b> and <b>commerce</b> sectors.
<br>
            <b>Augmented reality</b> is also transforming the user experience in areas such as <b>marketing</b>, <b>retail</b> or <b>tourism</b>, offering immersive and interactive solutions. It allows, for example, to test furniture in the living room before buying or to view lost historic monuments.
            Although promising, AR raises technological challenges such as the <b>computing power</b> required, as well as ethical issues related to <b>privacy</b> and <b>dependency</b>. Nevertheless, it remains a rapidly expanding technology with immense potential to improve the interaction between the physical and digital worlds.

    <h2>Virtual reality (1980s - present)
        <p>
            <b>Virtual reality (VR)</b> is an immersive technology that immerses the user in a simulated environment of <b>3D</b>, often interactive. This experience is made possible by <b>helmets</b> with displays, <b>motion sensors</b> and sometimes <b>manual controllers</b>, which allow you to navigate and interact in a virtual world. Although its first 
            The foundations are laid as early as <b>1960</b>, VR begins to take concrete form in the 1980s</b> thanks to significant technological advances.
<br>
            The term "<b>virtual reality</b>" is popularized by <b>Jaron Lanier</b>, founder of <b>VPL Research</b>, which develops <b>VR helmets</b> and <b>data gloves</b> for touch interaction with digital environments. These systems, although cutting edge, are expensive and limited by the <b>computing power</b> of the time, which limits their adoption to specialized sectors 
            such as <b>research</b>, <b>medicine</b> or <b>military training</b>.
<br>
            In the 1990s, VR attracted the attention of the general public through experiments such as arcade simulators or immersive devices presented by companies like <b>SEGA</b> and <b>Nintendo</b>. However, these early attempts are hampered by <b>cost</b> issues, low <b>resolution</b> and limited effectiveness, preventing mass adoption.
            The beginning of <b>2010</b> marked a new era in VR with the introduction of more powerful and affordable helmets such as the Oculus Rift, followed by competing products like the <b>HTC Vive</b>, the <b>PlayStation VR</b> or the <b>Meta Quest</b>. These devices use <b>high definition displays</b>, precise <b>sensors</b> and sophisticated <b>algorithms</b> to provide immersive experience without 
            previous. The VR then extends to many areas, including <b>video games</b>, <b>vocational training</b>, <b>medicine</b>, <b>architecture</b> and even <b>virtual tourism</b>.
<br>
            Today, VR continues to evolve with the integration of technologies such as <b>eye tracking</b>, <b>mixed reality</b> (which combines VR and augmented reality), and haptic accessories that enhance the sensory experience. It also opens up new perspectives in areas such as <b>education</b> by allowing realistic simulations, or <b>wellness</b>, 
            by providing a soothing environment.
            Despite its promises, VR still has challenges to overcome, especially in terms of <b>cost</b>, <b>accessibility</b> and <b>comfort</b> (cybersickness). However, it remains a key technology in digital transformation, with unlimited potential to reinvent our interactions with the virtual world.

    <h2>Mixed Reality (21st century)</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>mixed reality (MR)</b> that emerged in the 21st century combines the characteristics of <b>virtual reality (VR)</b> and <b>augmented reality (AR)</b>, allowing interactive digital objects to be integrated into a real-world environment while providing deeper immersion than AR alone. It allows the user to interact simultaneously with physical and virtual elements, 
            while maintaining an awareness of their physical environment. This concept was popularized by companies like <b>Microsoft</b> with its <b>HoloLens</b> headset, which is one of the first devices to offer a mixed reality experience.
<br>
            Unlike AR, which overlays digital information on the real world, AR allows for a more complex interaction between the real and virtual worlds. For example, virtual objects can be placed in a real space and respond to user actions more realistically, as if the virtual object was actually there. This type of interaction is rendered 
            Advanced technologies such as <b>object recognition</b>, <b>3D mapping</b> and <b>motion detection</b>.
<br>
            The applications of <b>mixed reality</b> are wide and varied. In the field of <b>medicine</b>, it is used for surgical simulations, allowing professionals to practice in a virtual environment before performing real operations. In <b>education</b>, RM transforms learning by creating immersive experiences where students can interact with 
            3D models of objects or concepts, making complex materials more accessible. In the <b>architecture</b> sector, mixed reality allows architects and clients to visualize projects in 3D in a real space before they are built.
<br>
            Mixed reality</b> is also growing in the field of <b>entertainment</b>, with games and films that use interactive virtual elements in a real setting. In the business world, RM finds applications in <b>training</b>, <b>remote collaboration</b> and <b>product design</b>. By combining the benefits of AR and VR, <b>mixed reality</b> paves the way for 
            More fluid and dynamic digital experiences that were not possible before.
            Although RM is still a developing technology, it already has the potential to profoundly transform industrial, educational and creative sectors. With the continuous improvement of interfaces and devices, the <b>mixed reality</b> could well become an essential tool in the evolution of our interaction with the digital world.
