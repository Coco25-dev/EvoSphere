<h1>The Enlightenment and industrialization (18th - 19th century)</h1>
	<h2>Rotary press (19th century)</h2>
		<p>
			The <b>rotary press</b>, invented in the <b>19th century</b>, marks a major milestone in the history of <b>printing</b> and the dissemination of <b>information</b>. Its principle is based on rotary cylinders that allow large quantities of text and images to be printed quickly on paper rolls. 
            This invention, attributed to the German engineer <b>Friedrich Koenig</b> and perfected by <b>Richard March Hoe</b> in the USA, replaces the much slower platinum presses used since <b>Gutenberg</b>.
<br>
            The press is booming at a time when print needs are exploding, particularly with the rise of the <b>print media</b>, increasing <b>literacy</b> and expanding <b>newspapers</b>. Thanks to its production speed, it allows to print thousands of copies in a few 
            hours, making <b>newspapers</b> and <b>books</b> accessible to a much wider audience. In addition, production costs are falling, which is conducive to lower publication prices.
<br>
            Improvements made throughout the <b>19th century</b>, such as the use of <b>continuous paper</b> (rather than single sheets) and simultaneous double-sided printing, further enhance its efficiency. These advances allow the creation of large-circulation <b>newspapers</b>, such as <b>daily newspapers</b> 
            popular, which become a key vector of information and education for the masses.
<br>
            The press also influences other sectors, such as <b>book publishing</b>, <b>advertising</b> and <b>industrial printing</b>. It contributes to the standardization of publications and the development of <b>visual communication</b> through the progressive integration of <b>illustrations</b> and <b>photographs</b>.
            This technology has profoundly transformed society by democratizing access to <b>information</b> and accelerating the spread of <b>ideas</b>. By making a free and affordable press possible, the rotary press has played a central role in the emergence of modern democracies and <b>industrialization</b> 
            of culture. Today, although it has evolved with <b>digital technologies</b>, its legacy remains at the heart of contemporary printing systems.

	<h2>Typewriter</h2>
		<p>
			The <b>typewriter</b>, invented in the <b>19th century</b>, transformed the world of <b>writing</b> and <b>administration</b> by automating the manual transcription of <b>texts</b>. Before his invention, writing was done exclusively by hand, which was long and impractical, especially for repetitive tasks such as 
            Writing <b>letters</b> and <b>documents</b>. The first commercially viable <b>typewriter</b> model was designed in <b>1868</b> by <b>Christopher Latham Sholes</b>, an American journalist, in collaboration with <b>Samuel Soule</b> and <b>Carlos Glidden</b>. The patent for this machine was sold to the company <b>Remington</b>, which launched 
            the first commercial <b>typewriter</b> in <b>1873</b>.
<br>
            The <b>typewriter</b> uses a <b>keyboard</b> of keys, each corresponding to a letter or symbol, which when pressed hit an ink ribbon to print characters on paper. This innovation allows typing to be much faster than by hand and produces more uniform <b>documents</b>. Mechanical <b>typewriters</b> quickly became popular 
            in <b>offices</b>, revolutionizing <b>administration</b>, <b>journalism</b> and <b>personal correspondence</b>.
<br>
            <b>Typewriters</b> have become indispensable tools in many sectors during the <b>20th century</b>, including <b>companies</b>, <b>news agencies</b> and <b>public administrations</b>. Their influence is also felt in domestic life, especially through the appearance of portable and 
            affordable from the <b>1920s</b>. At the same time, specialized models such as the <b>electric typewriter</b>, which allowed typing to be faster and quieter, were born.
<br>
            The invention of the <b>typewriter</b> also changed the role of <b>secretaries</b> and <b>typists</b>, whose typing skills became essential. However, starting in the <b>1980s</b>, personal <b>computers</b> began to replace <b>typewriters</b>, offering additional features such as 
            Automatic correction and <b>digital text processing</b>.
            Despite its gradual disappearance, the <b>typewriter</b> has left a lasting mark on culture, symbolizing an era when speed and productivity were directly related to mechanical <b>writing</b>. Today, it remains a collector‚Äôs item and a symbol of the evolution of <b>writing technologies</b>.

	<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Education</b>, in its broadest sense, refers to the whole process by which an individual learns and develops throughout his or her life. It includes not only the acquisition of <b>knowledge</b> and practical <b>skills</b>, but also the learning of <b>values</b>, <b>social norms</b> and behaviours that allow for integration 
            in society. Historically, <b>education</b> has evolved in response to the social, political and economic structures of each era.
            In ancient societies, <b>education</b> was often reserved for the elites and was by oral transmission or through handwritten <b>manuscripts</b>. The teaching was centred on religious and philosophical <b>knowledge</b>. However, with the invention of <b>writing</b> and then <b>printing</b>, access to <b>knowledge</b> gradually became more democratic, especially from the <b>Renaissance</b>.
<br>
            Modern <b>education</b> took shape in the <b>19th century</b> with the establishment of <b>public school systems</b> in many countries. The goal is to provide mass <b>education</b>, enabling all children to access basic <b>knowledge</b>. <b>Education</b> is becoming more structured, with <b>school curricula</b>, specialized subjects and a focus on <b>science</b>, <b>language</b> and <b>mathematics</b>. 
            At this time, <b>school</b> became an essential tool for <b>civic education</b> and <b>social mobility</b>.
            In the <b>20th century</b>, <b>education</b> diversified with the rise of new disciplines, the internationalization of educational exchanges, and the inclusion of all social strata. Educational reforms also aim to adapt <b>education</b> to technological, economic and cultural changes. Higher <b>education</b> is developing, and <b>universities</b> are becoming places of <b>research</b> and <b>innovation</b>.
<br>
            Today, <b>education</b> continues to transform with the integration of <b>digital technologies</b>, the focus on <b>lifelong learning</b> and the equalization of educational opportunities in many parts of the world. <b>Education</b> plays a crucial role in personal development, <b>social cohesion</b> and <b>economic progress</b>, while being a pillar of <b>democracy</b> and 
            <b>social justice</b>. The major challenge remains to make <b>education</b> accessible to all, regardless of their origin, social status or geography.
