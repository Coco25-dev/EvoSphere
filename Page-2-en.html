<h1>The Middle Ages (5th to 15th century)</h1>
	<h2>Parchment</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Parchment</b>, a writing medium made from animal skins (notably sheep, goats or calves), appears in the 2nd century BC in the city of Pergamon, Anatolia, in response to a shortage of papyrus. 
			This material offers several advantages over papyrus: it is more resistant, can be written on both sides, and is better preserved in various climates. The production of <b>parchment</b> requires a complex process: 
			The skins are cleaned, soaked in lime to remove hair, stretched on frames, then scraped and polished to obtain a smooth surface suitable for writing.
<br>
            <b>Parchment</b> quickly became the preferred medium for important manuscripts, including religious, scientific and legal texts. It is often used in the form of a <b>codex</b>, a bound book format that replaces gradually the papyrus 
            scroll thanks to its practicality and ease of consultation. Medieval <b>manuscripts</b>, often richly decorated with illuminations and miniatures, testify to the exceptional quality of the <b>parchment</b> and its central role in the transmission of knowledge.  
<br>
            Although more expensive and laborious to produce than papyrus, <b>parchment</b> was popular in Europe throughout the Middle Ages because of its durability. It is particularly used by the monks copyists in monasteries, where they produce 
            major works such as the Gospels and encyclopedias. Medieval libraries are thus mainly made up of scrolls in <b>parchment</b>.
<br>
            The arrival of paper, imported from Asia via Muslim Spain in the 12th century, eventually reduced the use of <b>parchment</b>. However, it remains used for prestigious or official documents, such as royal charters, until the modern era. 
            Today, ancient scrolls are precious witnesses to the history of writing and crafts, preserved in libraries and museums around the world. They illustrate a key stage in the evolution of writing media, combining 
            sophistication and sustainability.

	<h2>Manuscripts</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Manuscripts</b>, from the Latin manu scriptus (handwritten), refer to texts written by hand before the invention of printing in the fifteenth century. They are mainly made on media such as <b>parchment</b> or, later, paper. The 
			medieval <b>manuscripts</b>, produced between the 5th and 15th centuries, are an essential part of the transmission of religious, scientific and literary knowledge.
<br>
            In monasteries, scribe monks work in scriptoriums, where they patiently copy texts using goose feathers dipped in ink. These books are often accompanied by illuminations, colourful illustrations and 
            in detail, made by hand. These decorations are not only intended to embellish the <b>manuscripts</b>, but also to highlight important passages and guide reading. Some <b>manuscripts</b>, such as the Gospels or the books of hours, are true works of art, 
            Adorned with golden initials and miniatures illustrating biblical scenes.   
<br>
            <b>Manuscripts</b> have played a crucial role in the preservation of knowledge from antiquity. Texts by Greek, Roman and Arabic philosophers have been copied and translated, often in intellectual centers such as Toledo, Baghdad or Constantinople. These works have 
            The development of medieval universities and the emergence of the Renaissance.
<br>
            The production of <b>manuscripts</b> has diversified with the arrival of paper, which is less expensive than <b>parchment</b>. This change has allowed for a wider dissemination of texts, including literary, scientific and administrative works. However, the realization of <b>manuscripts</b> 
            It was a long and costly task, reserved for the elites and religious institutions.
<br>
            With the invention of printing by Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, <b>manuscripts</b> begin to disappear, replaced by printed books, faster to produce and accessible to a wider audience. However, the <b>manuscripts</b> remain invaluable witnesses to 
            The history of writing, art and thought, offering a direct insight into cultural and intellectual practices of past eras.

	<h2>Codex</h2>
		<p>
			The <b>codex</b>, ancestor of the modern book, is a form of bound work that gradually replaces papyrus and <b>parchment</b> rolls from the 1st century AD. .-C. This format, first adopted by the Romans, consists of individual sheets, usually in <b>parchment</b>, folded into notebooks, 
			Linked together, and protected by a hard cover. Compared to rolls, the <b>codex</b> has many advantages: it is more compact, easier to handle and allows a quick consultation, because it is possible to go directly to a specific page rather than unrolling an entire roll.
<br>
            The <b>codex</b> is gradually gaining ground thanks to its durability and practicality, especially for religious texts. The first <b>codices</b> are often used by Christians, who find this format particularly suitable for collecting the Gospels and other biblical writings. Their adoption by the Church contributes to their 
            Popularization in the West. Libraries begin to fill with <b>codices</b>, which allow more text to be stored in a smaller space.
<br>
            The <b>codex</b> also promotes the development of reading and writing techniques. It facilitates the use of tables of contents, footnotes and pagination marks, which are not possible to integrate effectively into a roll. These innovations make texts more accessible and stimulate 
            Apprenticeship, particularly in schools and universities of the Middle Ages.
<br>
            Over the centuries, the <b>codex</b> became a true work of art. They are often decorated with illuminations, coloured lettering and elaborate bindings. The transition to paper in the 14th century made their production less expensive, which contributed to their dissemination to a wider audience. However, the appearance of 
            of printing in the 15th century marks the beginning of the end of the manuscript <b>codex</b>, replaced by the printed book.
            The <b>codex</b> remains a key symbol of the history of writing, representing a crucial stage in the evolution of reading materials. It not only revolutionized the way knowledge is preserved and disseminated, but also laid the foundation for the book as we know it today.
